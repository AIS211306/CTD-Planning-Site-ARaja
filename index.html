  <h1> Ankeeta Raja Planning site </h1>
  <h2> Brainstorm </h2>
  <p> Ideas: <p>
  <ul>
    <li> Making a website for my aunt who has a new shop of dogs </li>
    <li> Making a website for artists trying to display their art </li>
    <li> Starbucks homepage re-design </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Group memeber ideas </h2>
   <p>
   <strong> Dog Store Website </strong>
    <br>
    "At first, we considered my idea to make a website for a dog store, but we came across issues when trying to establish a real life client. Because the store was still in its planning stage and not opening anytime soon, we had very little to work with."
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Fashion Week </strong>
    <br>
    "Jesse's fashion week idea was another one we considered, but we had to drop that one as well, because despite the fact that there was a very viable audience, we didn't have a real life client."
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Jewelry Site </strong>
    <br>
    "After having two ideas shot down because we didn't have a client, we finally decided to go with Puneet's idea. His parents own a jewellery store in India, and they needed a website that can act as a catalog of their products for the store's clients. The catalog would show the pictures, catalog codes, and prices of the pieces, and would provide contact information to the store should the clients want to purchase their jewelry."
  </p>
  <h2> Choosen idea: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> We have chosen to work on the Jewelry site </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Questions we are asking the client: </h2>
  <p1> 1. What sort audience does the client have?</p1>
  <p> Clients form all over the world. <p>
  <p2> 2. What is the reason to make this website </p2>
  <p>  To show customers a catalogue of how the jewelry looks like and have them to get a chance to order it when overseas.<p>
  <h2> Objective: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Visually appealing page</li>
      <li>Shows a variety of products</li>
      <li>Shows contact information</li>
      <li>Instructions for how to order the products</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Feedback on story board<h3>

      <li> Change some things and add more words to make it more understandable so different people wont have to find around to see what they want without difficulty</li>
