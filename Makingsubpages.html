<h2> Feedback from others on subpages </h2>
 <ul>
   <li> work on ur subpages </li>
   <li> label the pictures or give a short description </li>
   <li> communicating - no idea where to go </li>
   <li> maybe this is hard but if you can maybe put a hover property where the user hovers over the picture and then it gives a description (instead of making a table with descriptions etc)
    </li>
