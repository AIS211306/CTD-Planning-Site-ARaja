  <h1> Planning site </h1>
  <h2> Brainstorm </h2>
  <p> Ideas: <p>
  <ul>
    <li> Making a website for my aunt who has a new shop of dogs </li>
    <li> Making a website for artists trying to display their art </li>
    <li> Starbucks homepage re-design </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Group memeber ideas </h2>
   <p>
   <strong> Dog Store Website </strong>
    <br>
    "At first, we considered my idea to make a website for a dog store, but we came across issues when trying to establish a real life client. Because the store was still in its planning stage and not opening anytime soon, we had very little to work with."
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Fashion Week </strong>
    <br>
    "Jesse's fashion week idea was another one we considered, but we had to drop that one as well, because despite the fact that there was a very viable audience, we didn't have a real life client."
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Jewelry Site </strong>
    <br>
    "After having two ideas shot down because we didn't have a client, we finally decided to go with Puneet's idea. His parents own a jewellery store in India, and they needed a website that can act as a catalog of their products for the store's clients. The catalog would show the pictures, catalog codes, and prices of the pieces, and would provide contact information to the store should the clients want to purchase their jewelry."
  </p>
  <h2> Choosen idea: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> We have chosen to work on the Jewelry site </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Questions we are asking the client: </h2>
  <p1> 1. What sort audience does the client have?</p1>
  <p> Clients form all over the world. <p>
  <p2> 2. What is the reason to make this website </p2>
  <p>  To show customers a catalogue of how the jewelry looks like and have them to get a chance to order it when overseas.<p>
  <h2> Objective: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> To make a visually appealing website that clearly shows the variety of products that the shop has. It should be easy to navigate between the products, and it should also provide the contact information and instructions on how to order the products. </li>
    </ul>
